AI Usage Statement

I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) in a limited and responsible manner during this project.

AI assistance was used primarily to reorganize existing code, improve structure and readability, and refine documentation and UI layout. It was also used for general clarification while debugging, but not to generate core logic or implement features.

All puzzle logic, backend functionality, database design, and feature implementation were independently designed, written, tested, and integrated by me. Any AI suggestions were manually reviewed, adapted, and modified to fit the project requirements.

I fully understand and can explain every part of the submitted code and am prepared to defend all design and implementation decisions.
